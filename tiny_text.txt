 I am trying to convert a python module (that contains the use of NLTK.Corpus) by jythonc. It is not able to include nltk dependencies
within the java class it creates. So when i use this class in java, it fails to recognize nltk. Can anyone please let me know how should i use nltk in python/jython modules so i can use in Java.
If there are any binary dependencies, you are out of luck. It won't work. You would need to write a RPC-Server then, with technologies such
as XMLRPC or CORBA.
Diez So does that mean that Jython does not support nltk uptil now. I ask
this because when I try to import nltk in Jython (which is assumed to
replace Python), i get the same error. Its just nltk that I am not
able to use. The rest of the jython functions and libraries work fine
within Java.
I don't know for sure - how about you post the error-message? Otherwise we
can't assess the problem.
